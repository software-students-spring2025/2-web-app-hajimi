Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **MongoDB** (Local or Remote)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git**
- **Virtual Environment (venv) **

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment 
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and define the following variables:

```ini
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### 5. Start MongoDB (If Running Locally)
Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the Flask application:

### 6. Run the Application
```sh
flask run
```
By default, the app runs on **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.


## Agile Development Practices
- **Discord Communication:** Use the teamâ€™s Discord channel (e.g., `#team-7`).
- **User Stories:** Documented as Issues on GitHub.
- **GitHub Issues Link:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/your-project/issues)

## Deployment
For production, use **gunicorn** or **uWSGI** with **nginx**. Example:
```sh
gunicorn -w 4 app:app
```
