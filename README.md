## User stories

- As an admin, I want to add new products to the system so that customers have access to the latest offerings and inventory remains up to date.
- As a user, I want to view a list of products on the home screen so that I can easily browse available items and quickly find what interests me. 
- As an admin, I want to edit existing product details so that any incorrect or outdated information can be updated to maintain accuracy and improve user trust.
- As an admin, I want to delete products from the database so that unavailable or discontinued items are removed, preventing confusion and maintaining a clean catalog.
