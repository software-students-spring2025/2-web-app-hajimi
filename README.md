## Product vision statement

Our Inventory Management System streamlines product management with a user-friendly interface and a robust Flask-MongoDB backend, ensuring real-time data accessibility, reduced inventory errors, and enhanced operational efficiency for businesses of all sizes.

## User stories

- As a user, I want to view detailed information about a product so that I can compare options, understand the price and availability, and make an informed purchasing decision.
- As an admin, I want to add new products to the system so that customers have access to the latest offerings and inventory remains up to date.
- As a user, I want to view a list of products on the home screen so that I can easily browse available items and quickly find what interests me. 
- As an admin, I want to edit existing product details so that any incorrect or outdated information can be updated to maintain accuracy and improve user trust.
- As an admin, I want to delete products from the database so that unavailable or discontinued items are removed, preventing confusion and maintaining a clean catalog.
- As a user, I want to search for products using keywords so that I can quickly find specific items without having to scroll through long lists.
